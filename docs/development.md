# Development

[简体中文](development.zh-CN.md)

Development and the full test suite use Linux (`/proc` is required for the profile lock), Node.js 24+, pnpm 12.5.1, and DSH `0.1.7-rc.1`. Browser tests use Playwright-managed Chromium and a Node HTTP/HTTPS forwarder.

## Set up and check a checkout

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm check
pnpm pack:local
pnpm smoke
```

`pnpm check` runs type checking, formatting, build, package/deployment/document checks, then unit, integration, CLI, and browser tests. `pnpm pack:local` writes `artifacts/dsh-auth-remote-0.1.0.tgz` after static checks; it does not publish. `pnpm smoke` installs that archive into an isolated DSH home, starts the pinned DSH runtime briefly, checks readiness, anonymous redirection/denial and an online CLI status, then stops it.

## Use the isolated development profile

```sh
pnpm dev:prepare
pnpm dev:install
pnpm dev:start
```

The scripts manage only `.dev/runtime` and `.dev/dsh-home` under this checkout; the default listener is `127.0.0.1:13090`. They reject an ambient `DSH_HOME` pointing elsewhere and symlinked development paths. `dev:install` rebuilds and installs the current archive even when the version stays the same. `dev:start` runs DSH in the foreground; Ctrl+C stops it. A source watcher can run in another terminal with `pnpm dev`, but rebuilds still need `dev:install` and a `dev:start` restart to load the new package.

For direct inspection, use the same isolated home explicitly:

```sh
DSH_HOME="$PWD/.dev/dsh-home" "$PWD/.dev/runtime/node_modules/.bin/dsh" plugin --profile web exec dsh-auth-remote status --json
```

The development home contains test account data. Keep it private and do not commit or copy it into a deployment profile.

## Test boundaries

`pnpm test:unit` covers the auth state machine, TOTP, backup codes, origin policy, translations, storage durability and lock recovery. `pnpm test:integration` exercises real HTTP/WebSocket sockets, native readiness, cookies, origin decisions and revocation. `pnpm test:cli` builds the real archive and tests interactive and noninteractive commands against isolated profiles and Unix sockets. `pnpm test:browser` boots rc.1 with temporary profiles and verifies the login and Security UI, native settings, workspace, upload/preview, SSE, WebSocket and an HTTPS forwarding chain.

Browser network traffic uses a Node HTTP/HTTPS forwarder. The dedicated self-signed certificate and key under `tests/fixtures/tls/` are test fixtures only; they are never packaged or deployment credentials. Chat uses a local model stub. No real third-party authorization or paid model request is exercised. The default browser is Playwright Chromium; `DSH_TEST_BROWSER` can select a local browser executable, and `DSH_TEST_BIN` can select another binary only if it reports exactly `0.1.7-rc.1`.

The DSH test runtime lives in `.cache/test-runtime` and is pinned separately from the source dependencies. Host services and React remain external to the client bundle. The [deployment guide](deployment.md) describes profile and backup rules.
